# Official Solara Project

Solara is a bot coded in [Python](https://www.python.org/) with [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
Solara was designed for administration and fun commands for your members. In the future, even better commands will be added!

## Origin

The idea behind Solara's project was to create a bot that could be the discord community's moderation and fun. Solara went online for the first time on **January 2025**, using discord.py.
